# Selenium Merchant Info Scraper [DEPRECATED]

## ⚠️ Deprecation Notice
This project is deprecated and no longer maintained. It is kept for reference purposes only. The code may not work with current website structures and dependencies.

## Project Description
This was a web scraping tool built with Selenium to collect merchant information from a gaming website. The scraper was designed to:
- Collect merchant location data
- Track available items for sale
- Support different regions and servers
- Export data to CSV format

## Original Tech Stack
- Python
- Selenium WebDriver
- BeautifulSoup4
- Pandas
- Chrome WebDriver

## Historical Purpose
This tool was originally created to help players track merchant locations and available items in the game. Due to website changes and game updates, this tool is no longer functional.

## Note for Future Reference
If you're looking to build something similar, consider:
- Using modern web scraping techniques (e.g., API endpoints if available)
- Implementing rate limiting and error handling
- Following the website's terms of service and robots.txt
- Using async operations for better performance
